# aspnet-docker
My docker file for ASP.NET applications in Docker/Mono.

The Dockerfile is the current RC1 version for using ASP.NET with Docker. As this changes it will be updated.

# Extras

*DockerBuild.sh is a very simple script meant to take two lines of code and make them into one*

*GitCheck.sh is again a simple script designed to compare the local repo to the remote repo if they are not the same the scripts performs a git pull to update the local repo.*

Used together they can make a very simple continuous integration methodology for your .NET project on Docker. :)
